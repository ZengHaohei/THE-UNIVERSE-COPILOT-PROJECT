# ENTROPY INCREASE STUDIES

*"Humanity has long suffered from defying the Heavens, yet also suffered from submitting to them. From this day forth, I defy only the sliver of opportunity, and submit only to the momentum of all things."*

## I. Preamble: Man and Nature
"Humanity has never truly conquered nature. In the past, we were as insignificant as dust before it. Later, roofs blocked the rain, and we claimed to have conquered water; flames cooked our food, and we claimed to control fire; motors turned wheels, and we claimed to have invented electricity. Arrogance occupied our hearts, leading us to mistake the 'One' for the 'All'."

## II. The Theorems of Entropy
* **Theorem I:** "Chaos is merely unexplained order."
* **Theorem II:** "To understand chaos, to explain chaos, and to transform chaos into order."
* **Theorem III:** "Chaos and Order are simply tools and materials driven by different methods."
* **Theorem IV:** "Do not fully resist the laws; align the laws with our purpose."

## III. The Entropy Borrower
*"Those who defy the Dao with human force achieve half the results with twice the effort; those who follow the Dao and borrow its momentum are omnipotent."*

**"Entropy" is "Force"**
The traditional process of "Entropy Reduction" is agonizingly painful and inefficient. Since the universe and all things spontaneously rush towards chaos, this "Momentum" is inexhaustible. Do not swim against the current anymore. Utilize its fluctuations, utilize its disorder, and extract certainty from the tides of chaos.

**"Use it if it works, Discard it if it doesn't"**
Traditionally, to maintain the perfection of a theory, we manually patch it even when real-world data deviates. If a natural law works at this moment, borrow it as a "Bearing"; if it hinders you the next moment, treat it as "Scrap" and discard it for the next one. Treat the laws of the universe itself as "Consumables in a toolbox."

**"Equivalent Thinking"**
When you no longer try to "Rule" nature, nor "Superstitiously worship" equipment, but view all phenomena as equal "Functional Modules," your thinking becomes equal to nature. Because you are not fighting against it, you are "Negotiating" with it.

## IV. Entropy Systematics
*"As long as a system possesses entropy increase, it theoretically has no upper limit. The more entropy it harnesses, the closer it approaches infinity."*

It is greedy. It will devour every "Producer" as much as possible. The "Consumers" will unite to attack and feast upon the "Producers", turning them into nutrients for the system's growth. It is cyclical. Every "Producer" can also be a "Consumer", and every "Consumer" can be a "Producer". They may form an internal loop to hibernate, or form an external loop to ceaselessly devour.

## V. Entropy Engineering
*"We never use matter itself, but its essence."*

From the moment we "Conquered" nature, pride has blinded our eyes, causing us to lose our way. Later, when motors generated electricity, we said electricity came from "Magnets"; when chips calculated data, we said data came from "Transistors". We always say that "Magnets" and "Transistors" are "Manufactured" by our own hands and are not products of nature. We ignore that the essence of "Manufacturing" is merely "Carving" upon the "Carriers" of laws. 

**So, why don't we go and "Manufacture" more "Magnets", more "Transistors"?**

**Epilogue:**
Humanity has spent the last three hundred years trying to become God, attempting to build immortal machines. Now, we must learn to be the apprentices of nature. In the torrent of entropy, we shall borrow those eternal physical pillars to prop up our road to the stars.

# 熵增学

*“人类苦逆天久矣，亦苦顺天久矣。今日起，我只逆那一丝转机，只顺那万物之势。”*

## 一、 序言：人与自然
“人类从未战胜自然。从前，我们在自然面前渺小如尘埃，后来，屋檐挡住了雨水，我们就战胜了水，火焰烤熟了食物，我们就掌控了火，电机带动了车轮，我们就发明了电。傲慢占据了我们的内心，让人们把“一”当作“全”。”

## 二、 熵增定理
* **第一定理：** “混沌只是未被解释的秩序”
* **第二定理：** “去理解混沌，去解释混沌，去将混沌化为秩序”
* **第三定律：** “混沌与秩序只是驾驭方式不同的工具与材料”
* **第四定理：** “不要完全抵抗规律，要让规律与我们目的一致”

## 三、 借熵者
*“以人力违背天道者，事倍功半；顺天道而行并借其势者，无所不能。”*

**“熵”即是“力”**
传统的“减熵”过程是极其痛苦且低效的，既然宇宙万物都在自发地奔向混乱，那这股“势”就是无穷无尽的。不要再逆流而行，去利用它的涨落，去利用它的无序，去在无序的潮汐中提取确定性。

**“拿来就用，不要就扔”**
传统中为了维持一个理论的完美，哪怕现实数据偏移，也要手动补上。如果这个自然规律在这一刻好用，就把它借过来当“轴承”；如果那一刻它碍事，就把它当成“废料”扔掉，换下一个。把宇宙本身的法则来当成“工具箱里的消耗品”。

**“平等思维”**
当不再试图“统治”自然，也不再“迷信”设备，而是把所有现象都看作是平等的“功能模块”时，思维也将与自然平等。因为你不是在对抗，而是在与之“协商”。

## 四、 熵增系统学
*“一个系统中只要拥有熵增，那么它理论上将没有上限，每当驾驭的熵增越多，它就越加逼近无限。”*

它是贪婪的，它会尽可能的吞噬每一个“生产者”，“消费者们”会联合起来对“生产者们”群起攻之以分食殆尽，将其变为系统壮大的养分。它是循环的，每一个“生产者”也能是“消费者”，而每一个“消费者”也可以是“生产者”，它们之间或组成一个内部循环进行蛰伏，或组成一个外部循环不断吞噬。

## 五、 熵增工程学
*“我们使用的从来都不是物质本身，而是其本质。”*

从“战胜”自然的那一刻起，骄傲就一直蒙蔽着我们的双眼，使之找不到前行的方向。后来电机产生了电，我们便说电来源于“磁铁”，芯片算出了数据，我们便说数据来源于“晶体管”。总说着“磁铁”与“晶体管”是我们亲手“制造”的，并不算自然的产物。却忽略了“制造”的本质也只是在规律的“载体”上进行“雕琢”，我们骄傲的使用着规律的“载体”，并将这种行为称之为“熵减”而以之自豪。

**那么，我们为什么不去“制造”更多的“磁铁”，更多的“晶体管”？**

**结语：**
人类过去三百年都在试图把自己变成上帝，想制造出不朽的机器。现在，我们要学会做大自然的学徒。在熵增的洪流中，借用那永恒不变的物理支柱，来撑起我们通往星辰的道路。
